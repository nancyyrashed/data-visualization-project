# Data Visualization Project - P5.js

## Overview
This project creates *interactive data visualizations* using *p5.js. The visualizations include **tech diversity* (by gender and race), *climate change* trends, and other datasets. The project leverages *custom chart types* such as *bar charts, **bubble charts, and **doughnut charts* to visually represent important data points.

The visualizations are organized in a *gallery* format, where each visualization can be interacted with and customized based on user input.

## Features
- *Interactive Visualizations*: Includes dynamic visualizations for tech diversity, climate change, and other datasets.
- *Gallery Setup*: Visualizations are organized in a gallery for easy access and interaction.
- *Custom Chart Types: Features different chart types like **bar charts, **bubble charts, and **doughnut charts* for data presentation.
- *Responsive Design*: The visualizations adjust based on screen size, offering an intuitive user experience.

## Technologies Used
- *p5.js*: A JavaScript library for creative coding, used for rendering and animation.
- *mappa.js*: A JavaScript library for interactive maps and visualizations.

## Project Structure
- *index.html*: The main HTML file that sets up the page and imports necessary libraries.
- *sketch.js*: Contains the JavaScript logic for creating and displaying the visualizations.
- *lib/: Contains external libraries like **p5.js* and *mappa.js*.
- *visualizations/*: Contains JavaScript files for specific visualizations like bar charts, bubble charts, and tech diversity charts.
